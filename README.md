# Stock-Analysis-Script
Using Python to implement trading algorithms, this project takes these concepts and uses Flask combined with HTML to create a basic website that projects calculate trends in stock data in the future.
In order to run the file, run the python script
  python StockAnalysis.py
Then, visit localhost:5000.


Future Plans Possibly Include
1) ML Implementation to replace the current algorithms with a robust model
2) Increase the accuracy of the model
3) Implement more CSS and improve the website
